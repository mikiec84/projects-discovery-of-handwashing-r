description    : >
  Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: Handwashing.
long_description: |
  In 1847 the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. 

  In this R project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using `dplyr` and make simple plots using `ggplot2`. You can learn these skills in the course [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse).
